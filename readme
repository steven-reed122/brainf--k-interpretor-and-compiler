This is a interpreter, compiler, and optimized-compiler for 
the popular esoteric programming language call "brainfuck". 
It reads a series of brainfuck valid characters token by token 
executes them.

It will disregard all characters in the code that are not part 
of the brainfuck language.

To run this program, run the bf-website.html file using google chrome.

Brainfuck was created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller 
as an experiment into how minimal a program language 
can be. It contains only 8 valid characters that each serve as 
one command. These commands function on a data pointer that exists 
on some theoretically infinite array of two-byte values.

">"	Increments the data pointer by one (makes it points at the cell right of the current cell)
"<"	Decrement the data pointer by one (makes it points at the cell left of the current cell)
"+"	Increment the byte at the data pointer by one.
"-"	Decrement the byte at the data pointer by one.
"."	Output the byte at the data pointer.
","	Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
"["	If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
"]"	If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching "[" command.[a]
